    <string name="welcomePageContent">Welcome to the BloodDonationBuddy App! This app serves a purpose to provide information about the blood donation process.
        It will detail what blood donation is and why it is a great act of kindness.
        You will also be able to learn about the various different blood types to learn what it tells about you,
        and what the blood donation process looks like.
        It even allows you to determine whether or not you can donate blood by asking some simple questions about yourself.

    <string name="typeAContent">Type A blood is the first of the four main blood groups. It consists of A+ and A- blood,
    both of which are determined by the presence of a protein molecule called the Rh factor. This is a protein that aids with the bodies
    natural defense and antibodies. This blood type group makes up almost 40% of the US population, with 33% being A+ and 7% being A-, according to
    the CleavlandClinic. The A in this blood group comes from the fact that the blood has the presence of the A blood antigen, which determines the A
    group designation. In general being part of the Type A blood group puts you in a common group with a large proportion of the population.</string>
    <string name="typeBContent">Type B blood is the second of the four main blood groups. There are again 2 groups for the blood group, which are
    B+ and B-, which are again determined by the presence/lack of the Rh factor protein. The B blood type is considerably less common than the A group,
    with roughly 11% of the US population being part of this group. This makes this group one of the less common blood types to have, and therefore
    the donation/reception of this blood group varies from group A, and there are a lot fewer donors for this blood type.</string>
    <string name="typeABContent">Type AB blood is the third major blood group. It means that a person has both A and B blood antigens, and therefore they are a combination
    of type A and B, and therefore make up the AB group. This is very uncommon among the general population, with only around 5% of the US population being part
    of this group. In fact, AB- is the least common blood type in the US, with under 1% of the population having this blood type. This makes an AB blood type person
    extremely rare and reflects there donation/reception status.</string>
    <string name="typeOContent">Finally there is the fourth main blood group - Type O. This is different then the A and B types that make up the first 3 groups.
        This blood type designation means that a persons blood does not have A or B blood antigens. Therefore they fall into a different classification called O.
        The Type O group is interestingly very polar in its breakdown among the general population. O+ is actually the most common blood type in the US with almost 40%
        having this blood type, and on the other end only about 7% are O-. This is a large difference that constitutes different reception and donation eligibility for
        people with type O blood.

    <!--Donation Process Page Content-->
    <string name="donationTitle">Typical Blood Donation Process</string>

    <string name="arrive">Arrive to Donation Center</string>
    <string name="checkup">Complete Checkup and Questionnaire</string>
    <string name="donate">Donate Blood</string>
    <string name="refreshments">Enjoy Refreshments</string>
    <string name="satisfaction">Rejoice!</string>

    <string name="arriveDesc">When you arrive to the donation center you are expected to have had a meal prior to coming and have
    had sufficient fluids in the hours leading up to your donation. This is because your blood needs to be viscous in order
    to be drawn easily for a smooth experience. Upon arrival to the donation center you will have to present ID and check-in
    with the staff. This will then lead to you answering a questionnaire with questions about your self and then a staff member
    will verify the information and allow you to continue to the next step of the process.</string>
    <string name="checkupDesc">You are then given a quick checkup to verify you are in good shape and well in order to give blood.
    A quick prick from your finger to test your hemoglobin levels may be done in order to ensure your blood is in adequate shape for
    donation. You will then be brought to the donation room and the donation process will begin soon after.</string>
    <string name="donateDesc">You will be seated into a reclined chair and will be asked which arm you prefer to donate from.
    You will then be briefed on how long the process will take and any potential problems you could have. A typical donation
    yield is 450-500ml of blood, which is only about 10% of the blood flowing in your body. The area on your arm is sterilized
    and the needle is passed into your vein. From here it takes about 15 minutes tops for the blood to full the vile, and as its happening
    staff will be watching to make sure you are feeling OK. It is recommended to talk and keep alert to ensure an enjoyable
    experience. Once your done your insertion point is cleaned and bandaged, and you are given a final report of your donation.</string>
    <string name="refreshmentDesc">This may be the best part of whole process - the snacks! There are usually snacks and refreshments
    for downers after they are done, like cookies, chips,etc. Enjoy these snacks as a token of appreciation for your generosity
    and altruism - you deserved them!</string>
    <string name="satisfactionDesc">That was all! Congratulations on completing a blood donation. This is something that
    not everyone does, but for the ones that do its one of the greatest gifts they could give. You are providing a lifeline
    for a stranger that could save their life and all it takes is around an hour from start to end. You can donate blood multiple
    times a year if you would like, and once you have donated once you can have a donor ID that makes your donation process
    that much simpler. Giving the gift of life is perhaps the greatest gift of all, and you did just that!</string>
